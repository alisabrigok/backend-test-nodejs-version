# Sweet Sweet Node.js Version Of Some Other Project

This is the Node.js version of the exact work that is done here: https://github.com/alisabrigok/php-symfony-test

There are a few changings that differs from that project though.

- **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, **Express** and **EJS** are used instead of MySQL, Doctrine 2, Symfony and Twig which were the ones that's used in the other one.
- The command won't make any database interactions this time. It will just make the comparison and show you the result on the command shell. The database operations are done on home page request instead.

Also the command is:

```
$ npm run currency-comparison
```
