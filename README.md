# Sweet Sweet Node.js Version Of Some Another Project

Node.js version of the exact work that is done here: https://github.com/alisabrigok/php-symfony-test

There is a single changing though, that is, the command won't make any database interaction this time. It will just make the comparison and show you the result on the command shell. The database operations are done on home page request instead.

Also this time the command is

```
$ npm run currency-comparison
```
